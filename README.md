## üëã About This Project

This repository contains a **modern, frontend-only blog application** built with React. The project's core purpose is to showcase robust frontend development skills, including **component architecture**, **client-side routing**, **data manipulation**, and **comprehensive test automation**.

The application uses a **local mock data file** instead of a live backend, allowing for focused demonstration of UI development, interaction logic, and advanced testing techniques.

---

## ‚ú® Key Frontend Skills Practiced

* **Component Architecture:** Built reusable components for the Header, Post Card, Home Page, and Post Detail views.
* **Client-Side Routing:** Implemented **React Router** to manage navigation between the main blog list and individual post pages (`/posts/:id`).
* **Data Handling:** Successfully imported and manipulated local JavaScript objects (mock data) using array methods (`map`, `find`) to render dynamic content.
* **Responsive UI:** Styled using the **Bootstrap 5** framework to ensure a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly design.
* **Modern Tooling:** Built with **Vite** for a fast and efficient development workflow.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Implemented a full test suite using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library (RTL)** to verify component behavior, form submission logic (with Axios mocking), and correct routing.
