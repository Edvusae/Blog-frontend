# üìù Frontend Blog Showcase (React-Only)

## üëã About This Project

This repository contains a **modern, frontend-only blog application** built with React. The primary goal of this project is to showcase core frontend development skills, including **component architecture**, **client-side routing**, and **data manipulation**.

Instead of relying on a live backend API, the application fetches and displays content from a **local mock data file**, allowing for focused practice on UI and user experience design.

## ‚ú® Key Frontend Skills Practiced

  * **Component Architecture:** Building reusable components for the Post List, Post Card, and Post Detail views.
  * **Client-Side Routing:** Implementation of **React Router** to manage navigation between the main blog list and individual post pages (`/posts/:id`).
  * **State Management (Local):** Using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to simulate data fetching and manage application state.
  * **Data Handling:** Importing and manipulating local JavaScript objects (mock data) to render dynamic content.
  * **Responsive UI:** Styled using the **Bootstrap 5** framework to ensure a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly design.
  * **Modern Tooling:** Built with **Vite** for a fast and efficient development workflow.
